My name is Akshay, and I am a software developer based in Victoria, British Columbia. I've been programming for the past decade, striving to write quality software that solves real problems.  I have more than four years of professional experience as a full-stack .NET developer. 

I have worked on all layers of the stack, including the database, back-end, and front-end. Most of my professional experience has been in the Windows and Azure ecosystem, with a few side projects on Linux. I am proficient in C# and TypeScript, as I used them daily at my previous companies. On the framework side, I am competent in .NET and Node ecosystems. I also have some DevOps experience with Docker. 

A few months ago (March 2021), I started learning and experimenting with Ruby for one of my side-projects. After working with C# and .NET for the past six years, it was a breath of fresh air. Within a week, I was in love with this beautiful programming language. After a few months of working in Ruby (and Rails), I made a big decision to switch from being an enterprise C#/.Net developer to a Ruby and Rails programmer.  

I did my Master's in Computer Science from the University of Victoria. My work involved designing & implementing a scalable algorithm to find the most influential users in a network. I published a short paper based on my thesis in EDBT Vienna 2018 (Microsoft Research). You can find a copy of my thesis [here](https://dspace.library.uvic.ca//handle/1828/8885).   

As a software developer, my primary goal is to build useful software that solves problems and provides value to the users, and I approach all my projects with the same mindset. I am very passionate about software development and am always looking forward to learning new skills and becoming a better software developer.

Thanks for stopping by.
