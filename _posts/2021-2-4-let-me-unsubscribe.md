Don't you just love when your entire sign-up workflow is done in minutes, and your bank transactions involving money are done in seconds, but a simple 'unsubscribe' from the marketing emails **may take up to 10 business days** to take effect?

<div class="random centered">

  </a>
</div>

Come on, Tangerine, you are on online bank, just remove my email from your marketing email list, it shouldn't take up to 10 business days!!!

For what it's worth, I love banking using Tangerine, it's just these shoddy marketing strategies employed by so many online websites that annoy me so much.
