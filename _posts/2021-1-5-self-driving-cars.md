Gone is the optimism of just a couple of years ago. All that remains is the delusion of grandeur. 

Here's what [Waymo](https://waymo.com/) boss John Krafcik had to say on the current state of self-driving cars in a recent Financial Times interview.<sup>[1]</sup>

> “When we thought, in 2015, that we would have a broadly available service by 2020, it wasn’t a crazy thought,” he said. The thinking was: “Well, if we’ve got one prototype, then we can get to mass production in just a couple of years, right?

> “This was a position of — I wouldn’t say ignorance — but a lack of information and a lack of experience . . . We’ve become very humble over these last five years.” 

Uber spent close to a billion dollars to try to build their own driverless cars. Its goal was to have 10,000 self-driving cars on the road by 2020.

They [abandoned](https://www.wired.com/story/uber-gives-up-self-driving-dream/) their project last month, giving its entire driverless division to Aurora. <sup>[2]</sup>
