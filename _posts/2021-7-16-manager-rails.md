Since the day I started learning Ruby last month, I've wanted to build a real web application in Rails that does something useful. Finally, I took the last weekend to build the first prototype of Manager, an application that helps me track my finances and time. I have big ambitions for it, but for now, this is what I have. 

<a target="_blank" href="{{ site.images }}/{{ page.fin }}">
  <img src="{{ site.images }}/{{ page.fin }}" alt="Tracking Finances">
</a> 

To add a new record, you click 'Add New', which takes you to the following screen

<a target="_blank" href="{{ site.images }}/{{ page.add }}">
  <img src="{{ site.images }}/{{ page.add }}" alt="Add New Record">
</a>  

I can also log time on various projects I've been working on, which to be honest, is all Ruby right now. 

<a target="_blank" href="{{ site.images }}/{{ page.time }}">
  <img src="{{ site.images }}/{{ page.time }}" alt="Tracking Time">
</a>  

I will post updates as I have more stuff to share in future.
