title: New Edition of Philosophy of Software Design
---

John Ousterhout just [tweeted](https://twitter.com/JohnOusterhout/status/1420053240717086721) that the second edition of [A Philosophy of Software Design](https://web.stanford.edu/~ouster/cgi-bin/book.php) is out. I've been reading the first edition, and it's been an absolute joy. If you bought the first edition, you can download the [new chapters](https://web.stanford.edu/~ouster/cgi-bin/aposd2ndEdExtract.pdf) here. Also, check out my [notes](/books/a-philosophy-of-software-design/).
