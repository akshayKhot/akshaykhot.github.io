I resisted reading Jon Bentley's [**Programming Pearls**](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/programming-pearls-second/9780134498058/) for a long time because I thought it was about the Perl programming language. However, while skimming through it a few days ago, I realized that it's nothing about Perl but about programming and software engineering fundamentals.

It's not a long book; I finished it in a couple of days of concentrated reading. It's filled with descriptions of practical programming techniques and fundamental design principles, and I really enjoyed reading it. 

[Here](/books/programming-pearls) are the highlights and the notes I took while reading.
