A lot happened last week. I had a great interview with the Wave team, and they offered me a six-figure job as a Ruby on Rails developer on their payroll product. Wave is a Toronto-based company full of brilliant engineers, and I can't wait to join the team. 

**However, the condition is that I should be based in Canada.** Anywhere in Canada, but in Canada.

That means the next month is going to be uncertain about many things. If Canada resumes flights from India before the month-end, I will probably fly back (alone, as my wife hasn't received a visa yet) and start the job. 

However, if the ban is extended, I have decided to take a couple of months off as a self-funded sabbatical to stay in India, spend more time with the family, keep learning Ruby and Rails, and improve myself as a developer. This should be fun.

Again, I can't stress the importance of saving enough and not having any debts or loans to have the freedom to take this much-needed sabbatical. 

**The best-case scenario?** 

My wife receives her tourist visa, Canada resumes the flights, we both fly back to Victoria together, and I start working at Wave. 

Let's see what the future holds.
