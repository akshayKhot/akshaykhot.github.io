I have been working from home this week. Though I miss my awesome colleagues at CityView, I am also enjoying the solitude and the quiet work environment at home, where I can work in a focused state for a couple of hours straight without constantly getting interrupted every 15 minutes. 

Here's a picture of my home office on this bright Victoria morning.

    <img src="{{site.images}}/home_office.jpeg" alt="Home Office">
  </a>
  <div class="caption">Home Office</div>
</div>

Since we are all working from home nowadays, I'd like to recommend a book I read a while ago. Remote: Office Not Required is written by David Heinemeier Hansson (creator of Ruby on Rails framework) and Jason Fried.

It's a great book on how to make remote work, work. Their software development company, Basecamp has been remote for more than 20 years and they have some really unique insights on remote work.
