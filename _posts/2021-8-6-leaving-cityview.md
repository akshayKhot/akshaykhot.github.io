After almost four years at CityView, I have made the difficult decision to leave.

CityView is one of Victoria's best software development companies. It's full of smart people who know and care about what they are doing. 

I worked with some very kind, thoughtful, and wise people at CityView, and I will miss each one of them. 

At CityView, I worked on some critical projects such as Electronic Plans Review and Virtual Inspections. 

CityView has been very kind to allow me to work from India for the past year so that I could stay close to my family during the pandemic. 

I am leaving with wonderful memories and will always cherish my time spent at CityView, who has been like a second family to me.

Farewell, team.
