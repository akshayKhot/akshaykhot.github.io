title: Things I Learned from Derek Sivers
---

[Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs/) has been writing his [articles](https://sive.rs/blog) for the past twenty years. Here is a distilled summary of all the ones that resonated with me. 

---

**How to write?**

- Write all your thoughts. Argue against them.
- Get rid of all except essential. Post the outline. 

**[Benefits of a daily diary.](https://sivers.org/dj)** 

- Write what you did, how you are feeling, even if it seems boring. Include the daily facts of life. 
- Do this for your future you. Years from now he will look back, wondering if you were as happy or as sad as you remember during this time. 
- Tag your articles with various relevant topics. 

**Don't be a Donkey.**

- Don't pursue too many directions all at once. 
- Think long term. Do just one thing for a few years, then another for a few years, then another. 
- You can do everything you want to do. You just need foresight and patience. 
- Focus on few things at a time, without feeling conflicted or distracted. 
- We overestimate what we can do in few months, and underestimate what we can do in few years.

**[How to deal with uncertainty.](https://sivers.org/d1t)** 

**Copy others. Shamelessly.**

- Your imitation will turn out much different from the original, anyway. Maybe even better. 
- Nobody usually notices the similarity. People don't make connection unless you tell the the source of its inspiration. 

**Let go of outdated dreams that keep you from noticing what's here now.** 

- If you have a too specific goal, you are blind to other new means. 
- Reevaluate your old goals to see if new means have come along. 
- Ask yourself what the real point it. Then look for a better way to get to that point. 

**[Avoid being rigid.](https://sivers.org/mfg)**

- If you keep experiencing the same things, your mind keeps its same patterns. Same inputs, same responses. 
- Your brain, which was curious and growing, gets fixed into deep habits. Your values and opinions harden and resist change. 
- To get smarter, you need to get surprised, think in new ways, and understand different perspectives. 

**Money is nothing more than a neutral exchange of value.**

- If people give you money, it's a proof that you're giving them something valuable in return. 

**Why am I here?**

- Look around. It's a useful question to ask occasionally. 
- Either it will re-focus your reasons for being where you are, or it will make you realize your reasons have expired and you should be somewhere else. 
- Many times, you are where you are is because of decisions you made years ago. But are they valid today?

**Don't try to sound Big.** 

- Don't appear flawless. Show a charming flaw. Vulnerability endears. 
- Be small and independent instead of big and corporate. 

**[Think slowly.](https://sivers.org/slow)**

- Don't have an immediate reaction, or don't come to conclusion immediately. 
- You don't need to answer. Take your time. Have an answer next day. Sleep on it. 

**Share whatever you've got**

- It might be a skill you have, something you own, resources, experience, etc. 
- If it takes some effort for you to share it, charge a little something, so you can continue. 

**To be happy, think like a bronze medalist, not silver**

- Your happiness depends on who you are comparing yourself against. 
- For ambition and getting better, use the reverse strategy. 
- Most of the time, be grateful for what you've got, for how much worse it could have been, and how nice it is to have anything at all. 

**Success comes from persistently improving and inventing, not from persistently promoting what's not working.** 

- Don't waste years fighting uphill battles against locked doors. 
- Improve and invent until you get that huge response. 

**[Unlearn](https://sivers.org/unlearning).** 

- Discard old ideas which are not serving you. 
- Doubt what you know. Stop thinking what you knew or believed is true. 
- Require current proof that it's still valid. Otherwise, let it go. [Subtract.](https://sivers.org/subtract)

**This is only a test. See what happens.**

- It's impossible to fail if your only goal was to see what happens!

**[Get Specific](https://sivers.org/get-specific)**

- Get specific about what's needed. Write down every detail you know. 
- Create milestones, and concrete action steps you can take next. 
- Research what you don't know. 

**Focus. Do not be [distracted](https://sivers.org/berklee).**

- Next few years are your training sequence. Ignore everything else. 
- Your enemy is distraction. Getting distracted by the noise in the world. 

**There are no speed limits.**

- The standard pace is to accommodate everyone. 
- The system is designed so anyone can keep up. 
- If you are more driven than most, you can do way more than anyone expects. 

**[We'll see.](https://sivers.org/horses)** 

- Events are just that. Just events. We assign meaning to them. 

**Show success before asking for help**

- You have to make your own success first, before you ask the industry for help. 
- Show that you're going to be successful without their help. Show that you have momentum. 

**Don't talk about your plans**

- Keep your goals private. Don't share them until they are achieved. 
- People who expect to receive a reward do not perform as well as those who expect nothing. 

**Sprezzatura**

- Hide conscious effort and appear to accomplish difficult actions with casual nonchalance. 
- Practice and prepare so well that you can put on an effortless performance.

**Do what you want to do.** 

- If you want to read, read a lot.
- If you want to write, write a lot.
- If you want to program, program a lot. 

**Not happy with existing venues? Make a new one.** 

- Don't complain. Go make things how they should be. 

**Make decisions as late as possible**

- When you have the best information. 
- Resist the urge to figure it all out in advance. 

**[How will this game end?](https://sivers.org/game)**

- The real problem is not thinking it through in advance. 
- When the game starts, it's easy to think short-term and get seduced. When it's too late, you realize what you have done.
- Before you start something, think of the ways it could end. Sometimes the smart choice is to say no to the whole game.
